# Arduino_led_blink
Blinking the led on Arduino Uno and observing the rate of speed for different delay values.

Arduino Uno is a microcontroller and can be used for various kinds of tasks; each task at once.
This is the basic program of blinking the LED of Arduino board and obseerving it for different delays when ON and OFF.

Usually, we can observe the blinking LED upto a certain extent. We can observe the led Blink (ON & OFF) above 100ms only. Below 100ms, we can oberve the LED blink with our human eye.
