This is the Embedded C Program for the Task(LED Blinking).
I tried doing this on the best Online Simulator Wowki.

Code:
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(13,OUTPUT);  //Declaring the pin 13 as Output.

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
  delay(920);
  digitalWrite(13,LOW);//the delay cant be observed from 100milliseconds to below.
  delay(920);

}

As mentioned in the comments of code, void setup() is used to declare the pins as Input/Output.
void loop() is used to run the commands repeatedly.
I selected the Pin13 on arduino Board as Output.
Delay can be changed based on the system requirement. 
Observe the different types of recordings for each delay mentioned(uploaded) in the project.
